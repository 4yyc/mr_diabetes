## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


```{r sample code}
# 這是一個 R 代碼塊
x <- 5
y <- 10
sum <- x + y
```

```{r sample plot, echo=FALSE}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y <- c(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)

# Create a scatter plot
plot(x, y, main = "Scatter Plot", xlab = "X", ylab = "Y")
```
